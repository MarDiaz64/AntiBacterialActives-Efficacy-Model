# AntiBacterialActives-Efficacy-Model
A linear ML Model for predicting the efficacy of certain common antibacterial actives.

Key Python Libaries Used:
Pandas, 
Tkinter(for UI), 
Pickle (for model saving as .sav), 
SQLite for the database
sklearn (linear model/linear regression) for the model itself
