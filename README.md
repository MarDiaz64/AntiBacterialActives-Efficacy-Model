# AntiBacterialActives-Efficacy-Model
A linear ML Model for predicting the efficacy of certain common antibacterial actives.
Data is potentially proprietary so the model itself cannot be uploaded but skeleton code will be included & updated.
Program also includes a redacted SQLite database file (.db) with said data.

Example of how the program looks ([] means that these would be loaded using the APIs wrappers who's implmeentation is also listed in the project):
